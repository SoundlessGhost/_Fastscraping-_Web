                  Any dispute that can&apos;t be resolved by good-faith

                  under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
                  Arbitration Association (AAA). The seat of arbitration is
                  Wyoming, the language is English, and the tribunal consists of
                  one arbitrator. Either party may instead bring a claim in the
