                <p>
                  Fastscraping is a managed web scraping service operated by Md
                  Khalid Mahmud Shawon (the &quot;Founder&quot;), based in
                  Sirajganj, Bangladesh. We help data teams, AI companies, and
                  enterprises extract structured data from public web sources at
                  scale.

                  our pricing pages, our contact form, and any direct
                  communication you have with our team. If you also use our
                  companion product <em>Scrayz</em>, a separate policy applies
                  on scrayz.com.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We are the data controller for personal information you give
                  us directly. When we deliver client engagements, we act as a
                  data processor for the data your contract covers — those terms
                  are governed by your Services Agreement.
