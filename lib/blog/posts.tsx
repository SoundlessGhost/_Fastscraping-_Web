        <p>
          Most scraping vendors promise they handle &quot;everything.&quot; That&apos;s
          marketing, not engineering. Protection stacks from Cloudflare, DataDome,
          PerimeterX and Akamai ship changes weekly, and a public page that collected
          cleanly last month can stall tomorrow. Here is an honest map of what stays
          reliable, what stays genuinely hard, and how we still ship data from the
          toughest public sources.
        </p>

        <h2>What stays reliable</h2>
        <p>
          The majority of protected sites fall to a properly emulated browser — not a
          headless shell with default fingerprints, but a complete, consistent identity:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Cloudflare Turnstile &amp; managed challenges</strong> — solved with
            real browser execution, matching TLS/JA3 fingerprints, and aged profiles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>DataDome &amp; PerimeterX</strong> — handled by passing the behavioral
            and device signals they score, not just rotating IPs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Akamai Bot Manager</strong> — sensor data generated correctly per
            session rather than replayed blindly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Login walls &amp; auth gates</strong> — persistent, aged cookie
            sessions instead of fresh logins that trip risk scoring.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What stays genuinely hard</h2>
        <p>
          We don&apos;t pretend everything is solvable on day one. The hardest cases we
          see:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Region-locked marketplaces.</strong> Some targets gate behind
            region-specific defenses — a marketplace can be open in one country and
            heavily fortified in another. On one large marketplace we run today, several
            regions extract cleanly while a few remain partial.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Heavy ML behavioral + device attestation</strong> stacked together,
            where a single wrong signal burns the session.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>App-only data with certificate pinning</strong> that resists protocol
            replay.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How we get partial wins</h2>
        <p>
          &quot;Hard&quot; rarely means &quot;impossible&quot; — it means
          uneven. Our approach on tough targets:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Per-region strategies and in-region residential / mobile proxies.</li>
          <li>Reverse-engineering the mobile protocol when the web is locked tighter.</li>
          <li>Shipping the endpoints and regions that work first, then expanding coverage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The honest bottom line</h2>
        <p>
          We won&apos;t quote you a fictional 100%. We tell you up front what&apos;s
          feasible, prove it with a free sample within 48–72 hours, and price only what we
          can actually deliver. That candor is why clients stay with us for years rather
          than months.

        <p>
          If you need web data at scale, you have three real options. Each is right for
          someone — and wrong for someone else. Here&apos;s the unmarketed version.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Do it yourself</h2>
        <p>
          Full control, and free if you ignore engineering time — which you shouldn&apos;t.
          A DIY scraper is cheap until the source adds protection, changes its layout, or
          rate-limits you. Then it becomes a standing maintenance burden that competes with
          your actual roadmap. DIY makes sense when the targets are simple and stable, and
          you already have idle engineering capacity.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Proxy providers</h2>
        <p>
          Bright Data, Oxylabs and similar sell <em>IP addresses</em>, not data. Proxies
          solve one slice of the problem — your origin — but you still build and maintain
          the scraper, the parser, the reliability work, the scheduling and the QA. You also
          still get blocked if your fingerprints and behavior don&apos;t hold up. Proxies
          are a component, not a solution.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Managed scraping</h2>
        <p>
          One contract, one team that owns the whole stack: reliability, infrastructure,
          extraction, QA and delivery. You describe the data; clean records land on your
          schedule. You trade some control for not carrying any of the maintenance. This
          wins when the targets are hard, the data matters to the business, and you&apos;d
          rather your engineers build product than babysit scrapers.
        </p>

        <h2>The cost reality</h2>
        <p>
          DIY looks cheapest on paper and is often the most expensive once you count an
          engineer&apos;s time and the opportunity cost of broken pipelines. Proxies have a
          low sticker price but leave the hard, ongoing work with you. Managed has the
          highest line-item cost and the lowest total cost when reliability matters.
        </p>

        <h2>How to choose</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Simple, stable targets + spare engineers</strong> → DIY.</li>
          <li><strong>You&apos;ve built the scraper, just need clean IPs</strong> → proxies.</li>
          <li><strong>Hard targets, data the business depends on</strong> → managed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Not sure which? Tell us the targets and we&apos;ll give you an honest answer — even if the answer is &quot;do it yourself.&quot;</p>

      "Why scraping pipelines break and how to keep them running — selector drift, schema validation, quality checks, and getting data into your API, S3, SFTP or warehouse.",

        <p>
          A one-off scrape is easy. A pipeline that delivers correct data every day for two
          years is a different discipline. The web changes underneath you constantly —
          here&apos;s what actually breaks pipelines and how we keep them alive.
        </p>

        <h2>Why pipelines break</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Selector drift.</strong> The site ships a layout tweak and your
            selectors silently return empty or wrong values.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Protection drift.</strong> A source that collected cleanly last month gets an
            update and starts blocking.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Schema changes.</strong> A field moves, a currency format changes, a new
            variant type appears.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to make a pipeline reliable</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Validate every run against a schema.</strong> Types, required fields,
            value ranges — a price of <code>0</code> or a null title should fail loudly, not
            ship.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Run quality checks, not just &quot;did it run.&quot;</strong> Row-count
            deltas, duplicate rates, field-fill rates. A pipeline that returns 10% of
            yesterday&apos;s rows is broken even if it exited cleanly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Monitor and alert</strong> so issues are caught and fixed before you
            notice — not after a stakeholder does.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Auto-adapt where possible</strong> and isolate failures so one broken
            source doesn&apos;t take down the whole feed.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Delivery is part of the pipeline</h2>
        <p>
          Data you can&apos;t use isn&apos;t delivered. We land it where it&apos;s useful:
          REST API, webhook, S3/GCS, SFTP, or a direct write to Snowflake / BigQuery — as
          CSV, JSON or Parquet. On the cadence you need: real-time, hourly, daily, weekly.
        </p>

        <h2>Freshness and SLA</h2>
        <p>
          Reliability is a number, not a vibe. We agree an uptime SLA, a freshness target,
          and a response time for incidents up front — then hold to it. That&apos;s the
          difference between a script and a pipeline.

        <p>
          &quot;Marketplace intelligence&quot; sounds like one thing. In practice it&apos;s
          a different engineering problem on every platform — Amazon is not eBay is not
          Shopee. Here&apos;s what tracking products across marketplaces actually involves.
        </p>

        <h2>What you can track</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Price</strong> — list price, sale price, per-variant, per-seller.</li>
          <li><strong>Availability</strong> — in stock, low stock, seller count.</li>
          <li><strong>Position</strong> — buy-box owner, search rank, category placement.</li>
          <li><strong>Signals</strong> — ratings, review counts, new-review velocity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The hard parts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Protection differs per marketplace.</strong> Amazon, eBay and Walmart each
            defend differently; what works on one rarely ports cleanly to another.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Region matters.</strong> Some marketplaces are open in one country and
            heavily fortified in another. On Shopee, for example, several regions extract
            cleanly today while a few remain partial — so we&apos;re honest about which
            regions we can guarantee.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Variants &amp; identity.</strong> Matching the same product across
            sellers and marketplaces (dedup, variant rollup) is often harder than fetching
            the page.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What clients build on it</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Dynamic repricing engines that react to undercuts within minutes.</li>
          <li>Brand-protection dashboards (MAP violations, unauthorized sellers).</li>
          <li>Assortment and gap analysis across competitors.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We&apos;ll tell you up front which marketplaces and regions we can cover reliably,
          prove it with a sample, and scope the rest honestly rather than promising blanket
          coverage.

        <p>
          Talent data and AI training data sit at opposite ends of the web-data spectrum —
          one is small, structured and high-precision; the other is massive, messy and
          provenance-sensitive. We build both. Here&apos;s how they differ.
        </p>

        <h2>Jobs &amp; talent data</h2>
        <p>
          Aggregating hiring data across many boards — Indeed, LinkedIn Jobs, Glassdoor,
          StepStone and regional players — sounds like a scraping job. The real work is
          afterward:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Deduplication</strong> — the same role is posted on five boards.</li>
          <li><strong>Normalization</strong> — titles, locations, seniority and salary into one schema.</li>
          <li><strong>Comp benchmarking</strong> — percentile bands by role and region, refreshed continuously.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Clients use it for wage analytics, skill-demand forecasting, and sourcing tools.</p>

        <h2>AI training corpora</h2>
        <p>
          Training data is a volume-and-cleanliness problem, plus a provenance one. Building
          a usable corpus means:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Crawl &amp; clean</strong> — boilerplate stripping, language detection, dedup (minhash / simhash).</li>
          <li><strong>Provenance</strong> — per-document source URL and fetch timestamp, kept with the data.</li>
          <li><strong>Licensing awareness</strong> — license flags, robots/ToS respect, and takedown handling.</li>
          <li><strong>Delivery</strong> — Parquet on S3 with a documented schema, not a pile of HTML.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Different shapes, same discipline: clean inputs, validated outputs, and honesty
          about what the data is and isn&apos;t.

          <strong>First, the disclaimer:</strong> this is not legal advice, we&apos;re not
          lawyers, and the law varies by country and changes over time. For anything that
          matters, talk to counsel. With that said, here&apos;s a practical map of the
          questions that actually come up.
        </p>

        <h2>The questions that matter</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Public vs private data.</strong> Scraping data that&apos;s publicly
            visible without logging in sits on very different footing than data behind an
            account or paywall.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Terms of service.</strong> Many sites prohibit scraping in their ToS.
            Whether that&apos;s enforceable depends on jurisdiction and how the terms were
            agreed — but it&apos;s a real factor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Copyright.</strong> Facts aren&apos;t copyrightable; creative content
            (article text, photos) is. How you use what you collect matters as much as
            collecting it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Personal data.</strong> GDPR, CCPA and similar regimes apply when the
            data is about identifiable people — regardless of whether it&apos;s public.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Computer-misuse laws.</strong> Circumventing access controls or
            degrading a service can cross lines that simple reading of public pages does
            not.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How responsible scraping lowers risk</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Prefer public data; don&apos;t break authentication to reach private data.</li>
          <li>Respect robots.txt and rate limits; don&apos;t degrade the target.</li>
          <li>Honor data-subject rights and takedown requests for personal data.</li>
          <li>Keep provenance so you can answer where any record came from.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The bottom line</h2>
        <p>
          Web scraping is not inherently illegal — but &quot;it&apos;s public&quot; is not a
          blanket defense either. The risk depends on what you collect, how you collect it,
          and what you do with it. We operate conservatively, decline work we shouldn&apos;t
          do, and tell clients honestly when a target raises flags worth a lawyer&apos;s
          look.
